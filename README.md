Regression using Linear, Poly, and Decision Trees

Some Classification is done using Decision Trees and Random Forest. An output file is created labeled 'TheIrisTree'.

Normalization is applied to the data and L2 Regularization is applied to the model to decrease overfitting and create more bias in the data.
